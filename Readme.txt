eloop has been downloaded from https://github.com/latelee/hostapd.git
within src/utils we can find all the files needed for eloop, copy only the files
needed as placed in dependency/hostapd_eloop directory.

within the directory "common" and "utils" are created, the files within common
was found in same utils directory wheras the file for utils is found in
utils/../common/


we need to add extern c in some file, TBchecked.
